# Virus-Spread

I implemented algorithms to simulate virus spread into some social networks. They were built with data from our surveys to different students. Our aim in this project was to get a first insight on how networks effects come into play during an infectious disease outbreak in our local schools. Modeling Covid19 and other such diseases can be extremely important in the prediction of their economic impact in our community.
